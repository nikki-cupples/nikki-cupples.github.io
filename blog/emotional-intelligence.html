                <p>Inherently, <strong>Emotional Intelligence is</strong>, "the ability to understand and manage your emotions (Harvard Business School, 2019)." Moreover, this applies to how we are able to comprehend and interact with the feelings of those around us. By being aware of how we feel and react within any given situation, we are able to heighten our self-knowlege which can be applied to both self-development and increasing social awareness. John Mayer's 2004 Four Branch Model of Emotional Intelligence, University of New Hampshire, breaks down this concept into four core aspects. First, the way we percieve nonverbal and expression of emotions can significantly impact our daily lives. Understanding personal strengths and weaknesses, alongside the recognition of how we process feelings, provides an increased amount of freedom to choose how we react to different situations. Subsequently, the utilization of emotions to stimulate thought encourages self-management through mental prioritization and healthy internal dialogue. In turn, this, "directs thinking toward matters that are truly important (Mayer, 2004)." As a result, Emotional Intelligence can have a positive impact on social awareness and relationship management. More specifically, being more empathetic and putting oneself into another person's shoes can develop meaningful discussions where both parties feel understood. By understanding and regulating our emotions, this can heighten our daily interactions in a positive way.</p>
                <p><strong>Emotional Quotient (EQ) differs from Intellectual Quotient (IQ)</strong> in terms of what attributes they describe within an individual's intelligence. As detailed by Alana Biggers from Healthline (2021), an IQ, "usually refers to your intellectual ability." This includes our ability to plan, strategiza, understand abstract ideas, use language and logically framing our mindset to solve problems. As aforementioned, EQ is defined from a social standpoint with skills that pertain closer to the ability to evaluate ourselves and others in an empathetic way. In addition, a higher EQ can aid in stress reduction and increase organizational abilities.</p>
                <p><strong>EQ is very important</strong> both in our personal lives and professional careers.</p>
                <p><strong>Increasing Emotional Intelligence</strong> can be facilitated through a range of different exercises. </p>
