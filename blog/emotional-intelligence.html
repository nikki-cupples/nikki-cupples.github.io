            <h3>Emotional Intelligence<br><em>September 9, 2024</em></h3>
              <div>
                <p>Inherently, <strong>Emotional Intelligence is</strong>, "the ability to understand and manage your emotions (Harvard Business School, 2019)." Moreover, this applies to how we are able to comprehend and interact with the feelings of those around us. By being aware of how we feel and react within any given situation, we are able to heighten our self-knowlege which can be applied to both self-development and increasing social awareness. John Mayer's 2004 Four Branch Model of Emotional Intelligence, University of New Hampshire, breaks down this concept into four core aspects. First, the way we percieve nonverbal and expression of emotions can significantly impact our daily lives. Understanding personal strengths and weaknesses, alongside the recognition of how we process feelings, provides an increased amount of freedom to choose how we react to different situations. Subsequently, the utilization of emotions to stimulate thought encourages self-management through mental prioritization and healthy internal dialogue. In turn, this, "directs thinking toward matters that are truly important (Mayer, 2004)." As a result, Emotional Intelligence can have a positive impact on social awareness and relationship management. More specifically, being more empathetic and putting oneself into another person's shoes can develop meaningful discussions where both parties feel understood. By understanding and regulating our emotions, this can heighten our daily interactions in a positive way.</p>
                <p><strong>Emotional Quotient (EQ) differs from Intellectual Quotient (IQ)</strong> in terms of what attributes they describe within an individual's intelligence. As detailed by Alana Biggers from Healthline (2021), an IQ, "usually refers to your intellectual ability." This includes our ability to plan, strategize, understand abstract ideas, use language and logically framing our mindset to solve problems. IQ can be broken down further into two subcategories; for instance, crystallized intelligence that is based on verbal ability/knowledge, usually developing with age. Fluid intelligence, the second type, describes our, "ability to reason, think abstractly, and solve problems without pre-existing knowledge (Biggers, 2019)." As aforementioned, EQ is defined from a social standpoint with skills that pertain closer to the ability to evaluate ourselves and others in an empathetic way. Similarly to IQ, the subcategories for EQ are ability, or how we conduct conflict resolution through emotional and social skills, and trait intelligence where we self-identify/analyse our typical behaviours.</p>
                <p><strong>EQ is very important</strong> both in our personal lives and professional careers. As analysed by the Harvard Business School team, "working with colleagues who aren't self-aware can cut a team's success in half and...lead to increased stress and decreased motivation." By developing our emotional intelligence, this can lead to many benefits such as stress reduction and increased organizational abilities. Moreover, a space to breathe forms between a situation and our response, giving us the necessary tools to choose how we react to different experiences in the moment. In addition, the increased awareness of those around us ensures that we are able to read a room, optimising how we present and conduct ourselves. In terms of the workplace, high levels of emotional intelligence can ensure effective cooperation and collaboration during team projects. Cumulatively, EQ has a significant impact on the ability to reframe our mindsets in a beneficial way, increasing drive and helping us to complete our goals.</p>
                <p><strong>Increasing Emotional Intelligence</strong> can be facilitated through a range of different exercises. Healthline recommends journalling, practicing mindfulness, actively seeking feedback, actively listening and paying attention to our emotions. Personally, I will be testing out journalling and mindfulness, alongside our listening and looping practical exercises to build my emotional intelligence. With my morning coffee, I will be committing to a meditation session using the UCLA resources. In a constant state of learning and developing, EQ will continue to flourish over time through our unique experiences.</p>
