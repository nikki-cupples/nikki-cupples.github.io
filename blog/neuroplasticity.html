        <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindsets
          <br><em>September 16, 2024</em></h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              <strong>Neuroplasticity: Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong><br>
              An exciting developmental concept, when we become aware of the possiblities surrounding our capacity to expand our skillset, understanding neuroplasticity can create self-confidence in tackling challenges and undertaking new habits. As analysed by Crystal Raypole and Timothy J. Legg (PhD, PsyD) in their June 2020 study <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain">How to re-wire your Brain</a>, neuroplasticity describes the brain's capacity to restructure itself when adaptation is required. Over time, "it can continue developing and changing," even reducing the chances of dementia or improving motor-skills after strokes or other medical conditions. By engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity, I will be able to strengthen my abilities over time, benefitting both my personal life and professional career.                   
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong><br>
              Through my research, I found a few key avenues used to increase one's neuroplasticity. At it's core, practice, putting information into relatable context, and understanding how our brains internalize knowledge establish the foundations of successful learning. Raypole and Legg mention a few central techniques such as learning a new language, playing video games (particularly puzzles, 3D adventure, etc), music, travel (even if it is a walk around the neighbourhood), exercise and making art. Common themes of improvements we can experience in our brain included heightening grey matter; for instance, in areas of language, attention/focus, memory, emotional wellness and motor-skills. Alongside this, there were also white matter improvements recognized such as problem-solving, creative thinking, multi-tasking abilities, and greater reading comprehension. By cross-referencing Healthline's guide with Joyce Shaffer's 2016 academic article <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960264/">Neuroplasticity and Clinical Practice: Building Brain Power for Health</a>, I found that each strategy has been researched in depth and tested on control groups. Notably, Shaffer comments on how, "environmental stimulation is critical for enhancing and maintaining cognitive function." In terms of music, after only four months of piano lessons a group reported increased cognitive abilities; although, integrating these exeriences into our long-term lifestyle will have the most benefits. In terms of exercise, a nutritional diet combined with regular exercise and enough sleep saw decreased anxiety and improvements in overall well-being. Subsequently, it was mentioned how, "mindfulness meditation could have antiinflammatory influences similar to those targeted by prescription drugs with a faster response noted in experienced meditators." Our choices and habits relating to taking care of our bodies have a huge influence on quality of life.

              In particular, Associate Professor (Chalmers University of Technology) Birgit Penzenstadler's presentation in 2022 about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtVeRAgRtXA">Benefits of Neuroplasticity Practices for Software Developers and Computer Workers</a>, was very interesting. She identifies and explains stress responses in relation to our physiology, such as the body's use of the parasympathetic nervous system, and how individual responses can be developed through training and mindfulness. By rewiring our brain, we are able to, "influence the vagal nerve to become more resilient." Moreover, the findings from the study her team executed across a group of 250 individuals are very enlightening. Combining the use of qualitative and quantitative evidence in a mixed-method approach, over the course of the experiment there was an overall increase in personal happiness, productivity, self-care and feelings of self-worth, to name a few. By simply taking the time to journal and complete breathing/mindful exercises, those who committed to the process experienced benefits in both their personal and professional careers. Personally, I will be testing visualising how I want to present myself for five minutes prior to having meetings and/or discussions to see if it will impact my social interactions in a positive way. My favorite quote from one of the participants is, "adulting has finally paid off!"

              <strong>Growth Mindset: Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</strong><br>
              Growth mindsets detail believing in our abilities, and the capacity to navigate failure or challenges in life. On the other hand, a fixed mindset entails the additon of internal constraints on what we think we can accomplish or attempt. It is important to note that we can have a fixed mindset in one area of our lives, such as health and fitness, while simultaneously being growth-minded in our careers. In Carol Dweck's Ted Talk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?subtitle=en">The Power of believing that you can Improve</a>, I was excited to hear about how a growth mindset, or the concept of 'Not Yet,' can dramatically increase resilience and our resultant performance levels. Rather than praising results, congratulating people on strategies and their attempts has had a huge impact on being able to attempt challenging tasks and take on new information. For example, I was inspired by the dramatic increase of children's grades observed in schools after adopting the new teaching method. Inherently, it is what we believe about ourselves that dictates our resultant performance, regardless of what the task may be.

              <strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong><br>
              After delving deeper into growth mindsets, I am feeling more proud of my achievements. It has become apparent that I have a tendency not to celebrate the process of growing, instead once I achieve something I typically go “what next!” While this is important, I do think I need to give myself more credit for the processes I am achieving now, rather than constantly looking into the future on what I am working towards. It is so important to give ourselves recognition for the progress we make alongside the achievements. In the future, I will integrate this into my learning journey by gradually reframing my mindset to continue striving to accomplish my goals, but also give myself credit for strategizing and the process of learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</strong><br>
              One resource about Growth Mindsets that I found particularly useful was James CLear's blog about <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">The Habits of Successful People</a>. His analysis of how each mindset, growth and fixed, can manifest in different real-life situations such as his experience playing basketball, deepened my understanding of what it can look like on an everyday basis. Moreover, I enjoyed the way he breaks down the concept into manageable segments; by increasing our confidence in different tasks, displaying how we can do something to ourselves first, this will gradually improve our abilities. Overall, thinking about "confidence, willpower, determination, and perseverance as qualities that could be developed through your actions."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</strong><br>
              These understandings about neuroplasticity and growth-mindsets are already shaping my learning plan. I believe that I am already in a growth frame of mind, but this can be continually developed and refined throughout my life (alongside the habits I choose to incorporate into my daily schedule). As aforementioned, I would like to practice my ability to recognize progress, attempt visualisation/breathing exercises, and undertake further goals in my health/fitness. By taking everything one step at a time and finding joy in each step of the process, I aim to be more present and enhance my mental capabilities.
