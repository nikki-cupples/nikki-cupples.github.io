            <strong>A time I was stuck on a simple problem</strong> was in the first section of the JavaScript Kata Challenge when we were required to establish 'allowedIn' as a true statement. As my first time writing a Boolean outside of the FreeCodeCamp resources, I quickly realized that I did not recall how to successfully code this in JavaScript. First, I tried the 'trying something' technique using my base knowledge/what I could remember. I attempted a few alternating layouts where I put an equals (=) symbol inbetween different combinations, using a basis of key/value pairs. However, it still was not working! 
            <br><br>Hence, to solve this problem, I utilized my research skills in combination with the Rubber Ducky method. The MDN Modzilla website was extremely useful in finding the correct syntax to declare variables as Boolean's. I was on the right track, however, needed to declare the key (allowedIn) as a Boolean, rather than trying to make the value simply 'true'. By explaining why the syntax was laid out in this format out loud, as if to a rubber duck, I was able to internalize the information accurately. During this process, I did feel a bit silly due to the answer being so simple. On the other hand, in the future if I encounter the need to declare a variable as a Boolean I believe that I can effectively write this code again.

          <strong>One occurence when I elegantly solved a problem</strong> was during Challenge 5, "use the find() method and return the first object that Scooby is hiding within." In the previous JavaScript module, I researched this method and was excited to be able to apply my knowledge in a practical way. First, I wrote pseudocode that laid out each step I needed to take to successfully find him. Subsquently, by analysing the test code (supplied on a JavaScript test document), I was able to identify that the array was constructed of 'door numbers' with a variable 'hiding' behind each door. From here, I was able to effeciently establish the correct function to find Scooby, as the find() method uses a callBackFn (Call back function) formed by three parts: the current element in the array (door number), the index (hiding), followed by which first instance I wanted to identify of Scooby (===, must be exact match). Overall, I am proud of how I was able to solve this challenge, feeling very accomplished throughout the problem-solving process. Through this experience, I have become more confident that with practice, I will be able to effectively solve any challenge that comes my way.

          <strong>To reflect on each of the problem-solving techniques/processes</strong>, I found that I am feeling more confident in different areas.
