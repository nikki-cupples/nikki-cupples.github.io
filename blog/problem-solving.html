      <h3>Problem Solving
          <br><em>September 20, 2024</em>
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
            <strong>A time I was stuck on a simple problem</strong> was in the first section of the JavaScript Kata Challenge when we were required to establish 'allowedIn' as a true statement. As my first time writing a Boolean outside of the FreeCodeCamp resources, I quickly realized that I did not recall how to successfully code this in JavaScript. First, I tried the 'trying something' technique using my base knowledge/what I could remember. I attempted a few alternating layouts where I put an equals (=) symbol inbetween different combinations, using a basis of key/value pairs. However, it still was not working! 
            <br><br>Hence, to solve this problem, I utilized my research skills in combination with the Rubber Ducky method. The MDN Modzilla website was extremely useful in finding the correct syntax to declare variables as Boolean's. I was on the right track, however, needed to declare the key (allowedIn) as a Boolean, rather than trying to make the value simply 'true'. By explaining why the syntax was laid out in this format out loud, as if to a rubber duck, I was able to internalize the information accurately. During this process, I did feel a bit silly due to the answer being so simple. On the other hand, in the future if I encounter the need to declare a variable as a Boolean I believe that I can effectively write this code again.    
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>One occurence when I elegantly solved a problem</strong> was during Challenge 5, "use the find() method and return the first object that Scooby is hiding within." In the previous JavaScript module, I researched this method and was excited to be able to apply my knowledge in a practical way. First, I wrote pseudocode that laid out each step I needed to take to successfully find him. Subsquently, by analysing the test code (supplied on a JavaScript test document), I was able to identify that the array was constructed of 'door numbers' with a variable 'hiding' behind each door. From here, I was able to effeciently establish the correct function to find Scooby, as the find() method uses a callBackFn (Call back function) formed by three parts: the current element in the array (door number), the index (hiding), followed by which first instance I wanted to identify of Scooby (===, must be exact match). Overall, I am proud of how I was able to solve this challenge, feeling very accomplished throughout the problem-solving process. Through this experience, I have become more confident that with practice, I will be able to effectively solve any challenge that comes my way.

          <strong>To reflect on each of the problem-solving techniques/processes</strong>, I found that I am feeling more confident in different areas, as analysed in the following table.

                <em>I enjoyed the methodical approach of utilizing pseudocode when figuring out the solution to each challenge. However, I do feel that I will need to practice more questions to become confident figuring out which code is needed to solve each step. Although, I was able to research each piece of missing information as I made my way through the broken down process, which pseudocode helped me identify.</em>

I quickly realised how useful this method can be once I began understanding the information through explanation. Similar to the pseudocode technique, trying to explain how a method works was extremely beneficial in identifying my knowledge gaps, while simultaneously increasing my confidence in each concept.</em>

I believe that for trying something to be effective, I need to be more confident in the correct syntax for each method. If I am trying different solutions, however it is not correct JavaScript, this simply added on time that was spent ineffectively.</em>

                <em>When utilized correctly, google is an invaluable resource. After the tutorial on how to research accurately, with the coding language and exact method entered into the search, the sources became increasingly reliable and easy to follow when finding solutions. In addition, I enjoyed the process of finding video tutorials that had step-by-step examples with visual aids. Sometimes, a code-along can be beneficial in helping us experience what steps are needed when creating different functions, etc.</em>

Reaching out to the people around us can sometimes teach more than researching for hours on end.</em>

                <em>Personally, I have really enjoyed reflecting on my work and attitude as I complete each Sprint. Prior to this course, I did not personally reflect like I do now. The process has become a habit, and I find that reflection book-ends my day as I start by meditating, then finish my work with a reflection. Moreover, I find it easier to leave my work within working hours, rather than being plagued by thoughts 24/7. In additon, this problem-solving technique is useful in improving my processes the next time I commence a new concept, with my performance increasing in effectively managing my time.</em>

          <strong>During my completion of the Kata challenge, I was relectant to ask for help during</strong> the Super FlipFlop challenge, instead spending quite a lot of time researching ways to make my code work. I did spend about an hour working it out, which could have been completed sooner if I had reached out on the foundations help desk. As my first time encountering using a function within a function, I was unaware of the best practice involved. As a result, I have two different methods; one long answer where I push the FlipFlop function to the new SuperFlipFlop one, and another shorter method. One of my peers had asked how to complete the challenge, and while helping him to figure it out, Joseph mentioned the map() method which was much faster and resulted in the same outcome! To reflect on this, in the future I would like to ask for help when I am stuck or have a question, as our coaches and peers might know a different, more effective code to complete the challenges.
