        <h3>Foundations Reflection

              <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong><br>
              The Human Skills learning exercises have been extremely beneficial in getting to know myself. In particular, my eyes were opened to how I interact with my self-critical voice. By understanding my internal reactions to not understanding something, I have been able to actively mitigate the sometimes unrealistic expectations I have on myself. Throughout each challenge, I feel that I am improving in my ability to be proud of the learning process, celebrating the small wins and gaining more confidence in my abilities. In addition, I have found that one of my strengths lies in self-motivation and determination to achieve my goals. Even when I am struggling, I am proud of how I am able to continue onward, even asking for help when necessary. In the past, I have leaned more toward figuring out where I am wrong by myself; however, following the Foundations course I have been increasingly aware that asking for help is a skill that takes a lot of strength and bravery. Finally, I have learned that I used to have a tendency to focus more on the resultant outcomes rather than enjoying the process to get there. Over the past month, I feel that I have been much more aware of the problem solving process, being happy with my working and actively searching for more ways to increase my performance in this area.

              <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Values</td>
                  <td>Our values directly influence how we percieve different tasks and potential actions. By being aware of our personal thoughts and what we see as important, this significantly impacts the way that we learn. More specifically, how we approach the learning process and our levels of resilience in the face of challenges. Resultantly, understanding our values can also aid in developing the ability to understand those around us.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Empathy</td>
                  <td>Empathy plays a huge role in learning and programming. As a highly collaborative field, understanding another person's perspective and having the ability to actively listen can have a significant impact on our daily interactions. Through increasing our emotional intelligence, this can also positively impact our reactivity. By seeing situations from an empathetic standpoint, this creates a space between an interaction and our resulting actions. In turn, providing the opportunity for each of us to clearly communicate and solve problems effectively, especially when working as a team.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Self-Awareness</td>
                  <td>When learning and programming, our level of self-awareness shapes our performance levels. Understanding what strengths and limitations we hold creates space for personal improvement, alongside positively impacting how we interact on a daily basis within our personal and professional lives. Inner thoughts play a huge role in how we approach tasks; what we believe about ourselves will ultimately form our resulting actions.</td>

              <strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong><br>
              As someone who has worked on personal growth and human skills in the past, I was surprised by how much I was able to learn about myself during this course. We are constantly learning and developing with our experiences, however, I did not realise how comprehensive the Human Skills segments would be at Dev Academy. I have already found out so much new information about myself and how I interact with challenges, hence, I am so excited to keep delving deeper. In addition, I have loved learning about the concepts of neuroplasticity, growth mindsets, and emotional intelligence. Personally, I am looking forward to see the new activities (journalling, self-reflection and meditation) become habits that are integrated into my daily routine.

              <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</strong><br>
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Critical Evaluation</td>
                  <td>
                    One aspect that I found slightly challenging was being completely honest to myself about my performance/weaknesses during critical evaluations. As a very optimistic person, I do tend to stay on the positive side of things. Although, when combined with my high self-expectations, this can be detrimental to my ability to ask for help when I am struggling. To mitigate this, I have started focusing more on the collaborative nature of programming, enjoying asking the questions that could potentially help other people too! I have enjoyed reframing my mindset, understanding that learning can be a collaborative process.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Creating Habits</td>
                  <td>
                    During the process of creating new habits such as journalling, meditating and reflecting everday, I did find it challenging to stick to the same time. While I did set alarms, I found myself procrasinating sometimes- something that is natural when we are training ourselves to take on new actions! To help with this, I started to pair these activities with a part of my routine (eg. brushing my teeth then meditating).
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Analytical Reflection</td>
                  <td>
                    Another part of the Human Skills learning that I found challenging was realizing how much energy active analysis takes during reflection. When we regularly critize our personal performance on different tasks, this does take a lot of deeper thinking for it to be truly effective. I found keeping within the time constraints when completing these sections slightly challenging, as I wanted to make sure that I was accurately describing my thoughts. On the other hand, I have been gradually getting better at this aspect, proving once again how practice makes perfect!

                </tr>
              </table>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong><br>
              By setting us up with Human Skills in addition to programming, Dev Academy is helping us to become well-rounded individuals who will be able to effectively integrate into the workplace. While learning how to programme is extremely important for my career, I believe that Human Skills stretches beyond my working life to encompass my daily habits and how I interact with others. Collaboration plays a huge role in the technical industry, where we have to work together to successfully complete projects. More so, the ability to understand who we are in terms of our values and identity can significantly increase our capacity to empathize with colleages. In addition, these skills will make Dev Academy graduates stand out from the crowd, with an abundance of knowledge on how to encourage our strengths and mitigate our weaknesses. Ultimately, increasing our performance levels and resilience in the face of challenges. 
              <br><br><em>"Accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference!"</em>

            <p>
              <strong>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
              Personally, I find so much value in learning more about myself, our brains, and how we can improve ourselves. Fundamentally, the way that we interact with different situations, whether that is in our personal or professional lives, determines how successfully we can achieve our goals. Without understanding ourselves first, this can put limitations on what we believe we can accomplish, which can hugely impact our actions and how we present ourselves. For instance, by thinking back on Carol Dweck's Ted Talk, what we believe about ourselves dictates our level of resilience, self-confidence, and resulting everyday actions. The only person who is capable of changing our lives are ourselves. In turn, I think Human Skills are such an important part of Dev Academy, holding a ton of value and skills that I will continue to utilize on a daily basis.
