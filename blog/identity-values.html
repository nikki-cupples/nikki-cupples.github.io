          <h3>Identity & Values<br><em>August 29, 2024</em></h3>
          <h3><em>"You are not special, you are ordinary, but you can do extraordinary things"</em></h3>
          <div>
            <p>As a creative yet analytical person, my values center around compassion, being yourself, and helping others. I am very ambitious, striving to always improve my abilities and learn from those around me. As my Mum used to tell me when I was younger, I am not special, I am ordinary, but it is within my capabilities to do extraordinary things! From a young age, I have been outgoing and optimistic, eager to learn about the world and gain knowledge to enhance my abilities, making a positive impact where I can. As a naturally empathetic person, even when I may not understand/have personally experienced a situation, I can actively listen and provide advice. Personally, I don't enjoy unsolicited advice, so I like to ask someone if they would like any of my ideas to resolve the situation or if they are just wanting to be heard. It can be challenging to navigate both personal and professional relationships, but I firmly believe that we are always responsible for our choices, words, and their resultant consequences. What is within my control I focus on, accepting the things I cannot change and changing what I can. 
            </p>
            <p>I have always loved reading, and believe that by learning from the experiences of others (particularly through self-development books), I have gained necessary skills that I use in my day-to-day life. If you also enjoy reading, here are a few that I would personally recommend: Seven Habits of Highly Successful people by Stephen Covey, Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway by Susan Jeffers, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman, The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason, and Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson.

            <p><strong>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong><br>
            One situation where I made an ethical decision was as a store manager, when I had to resolve a customer dispute about the shoes they had purchased. As a run-down of the situation, the customer called initially, saying that their order had not arrived and that they wanted a refund of their purchase. However, the terms of providing refunds entail having the product in-hand, which was somewhere with the NZ post. I helped her to fill out an enquiry form for her parcel over the phone, however the following day she arrived in-store to tell me that she was unhappy with my solution and that the post had told her that it was our responsibility (as the store) to work out what went wrong, not the customer. This did not sound correct to me, having dealt with post issues before, so I decided to go and speak with them in person. When I arrived at the Post shop across the road, I spoke with the attendent who knew the customer/had helped her, and found out that she had told them the same thing I did initially! They were investigating it, and the matter would take a few days to resolve. At this stage, the Post and I were on the same page, however, I still had an unhappy customer in-store. When I arrived back, I decided to print out a copy of her reciept for the order and the NZ post enquiry form. I dedicated time to listening empathetically, understanding her frustration from her perspective. By being able to physically hand her the documentation of how we were resolving her issue, she left the store happy. To reflect on this decision now, I am proud of how I was able to adhere to our terms and conditions as a company (by not simply refunding her for shoes that we did not physically have), while still ensuring that she left the store feeling heard and that we were taking action to solve the problem.

            <p><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong><br>
            Growing up, my parents had a massive impact on my values and identity. My Dad has always been on the more logical side, while my Mum is very free-spirited and creative. Through their collective efforts, I believe this has shaped me into a well-rounded individual who can evaluate situations and make decisions from both perspectives. I am grateful for the freedom I have had to make choices and form my own opinions independently, something that has set me up to be an independent and strong-willed person. Over the last few years, now in my early 20's, I have found that I have been influenced by the successes of those in my life. When I see the people that I care about achieving their goals, I am their biggest supporter and get very motivated to complete my own aspirations. After completing DOPE's 4 Personality Types and the Strengths Finder Quiz, I am also more aware of how much I value honesty from the people around me. With the high standard that I keep within myself, I do expect this from others and would prefer being told the truth over anything else.    
            </p>
            <p><strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong><br>
            While exploring my strengths, I have identified that I am proactive when learning, having the ability to take on feedback and pick up new concepts fairly quickly. In the past, I have flourished in fast-paced environments and can think critically from outside the box. I also reached out to my Mum and best friend Hannah to find out their feedback, and have been told that I have great communication skills. I believe it is extremely important to articulate ideas, questions and instructions clearly and patiently, in which I have experience to a wide range of backgrounds and ages. By actively listening, and being able to empathize and understand another's perspective, this has fundamentally shaped my work ethic and how I approach team projects. In addition, they both brought my attention to the strength of taking initiative. To be more specific, I plan my time with the bigger picture in mind, actively analysing and problem-solving the challenges that come my way, effectively enabling me to complete tasks to a high standard.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong><br>
            I am not perfect, and recognize that there is always room to improve both personally and professionally. Within my values, as brought to my attention by Hannah, I can struggle to ask for clarification or tell people if I don't know something. This trait has grown from my self-critical voice that is a bit of a perfectionist, repremanding me about not understanding a given concept. Although, when coupled with my optimism it does come through in a positive way that I generally find quite motivating. For instance, "You can do it," followed closely by, "why haven't you been able to complete this task yet?" As a point of growth, I feel that I need to learn to refine my critical voice to encourage growth without getting frustrated with myself if I have tried multiple avenues to solve a problem and remain stuck. I would like to work on being comfortable with the unknown, and asking for help when necessary. Another aspect that I feel will be important to work on for my career development is recognizing there is a give and take in leadership roles. Other people can be better suited to different parts, and can have more abilities than I do. Sometimes, I need to let go and simply do my part, trusting in my team and those around me.

            <p><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?</strong><br>
            During my time at AUT completing my fashion degree, I did encounter a few issues during one team project where ideas clashed and tensions rose. There were six of us working together on a group collection based around colour. With each of us having different ideas and definitions of what we believed the project entailed, it became apparent that compromises needed to be made. In this group environment, I was vocal about listening to everyone's ideas and buiding on them until we meet a balance where everyone has contributed. I found that with multiple strong opinions in the team, people were arguing and teaming up on each other which created resistance in the creative process. At one point, I was told by one of the girls that I had to re-make the garment that I had created! Talk about an intense and emotional project. It seemed to take forever, and the joy disappeared from the project quite quickly. Looking back now, after managing a store for ten months, I have gained experience in successfully completing tasks as a team. In hindsight, I think that rather than trying to incorporate all of our ideas into every aspect, we would have had more success delegating different sections to each team member, and working from there to make them mesh correctly. By each person having the "final say" in one part of the project, I think we would have had more success dealing with different opinions. Hence, allowing us to be productive, with everyone feeling heard and that our ideas were critisized in a constructive way.
