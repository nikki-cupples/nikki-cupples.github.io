              <td><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></td>
              <td>
                Following my studies at Dev Academy, I am eager to undertake the role of full-stack software developer. Long-term, I see myself in a leadership role. Through my experience in store management and having also achieved a Bachelor of Design, I will bring unique insights and a high level of communication skills to each task I undertake. While I do not have a particular company in mind, I would love to expand my knowledge base, work collaboratively, and am excited to contribute my ideas to both new and existing projects. I will be searching for a business that aligns with my personal values, where I can improve and learn from those around me. In particular, I would also like to work somewhere with global reach, with the aim of being transferred to work overseas where I can travel and increase my international experience.

              <td>
                During Bootcamp, I believe that my biggest strengths will be keeping up with the fast paced environment, being reliable in showing up everyday, and effectively managing my time. Over the course of Foundations, I have also discovered that I am very resilient when completing challenges, and am looking forward to pushing myself further. On the other hand, I do think that while I have worked on asking for help, I do still need to practice communicating when I do not understand something. Due to the fast pace of our learning, I am making a committment to reaching out when necessary so that I stay on track during the different projects. In addition, I have also discovered that I enjoy having time in the mornings to get ready for the day, so I will be getting up earlier so that I can continue my morning routine and start each day off strong.

              <td><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></td>
              <td>
                My biggest non-technical challenge will be keeping to time constraints and not getting carried away with finding out more information. "Just-in-time" learning has been a challenge for me, as I usually like to fully understand all aspects of different concepts. As a result, I will need to focus on completing the tasks in front of me, learning as I go to ensure that I do not get burnt out during Bootcamp. To stay healthy, I need to balance my workload with proper rest and not spend too much of my free time trying to research more!

              <td><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></td>
              <td>
                While at Dev Academy, I would like to continue increasing my ability to focus over longer periods of time and work effectively as a team. I would like to be able to navigate a variety of collaborative situations, regardless of who I am in a team with. The tech industry is huge, and I would like to be as versatile and adaptative as possible. Another area for development would be gaining more confidence in reaching out to others for help. As aforementioned, it is something that I find slightly challenging, and over the Bootcamp I would like to be able to clearly communicate my questions to get assistance when I am stuck.

              <td>
                To me, support from the Bootcamp team would be providing constructive criticism that can help me to develop and grow. During the fast pace of Bootcamp, I would also appreciate time to voice questions or ask for clarification if necessary. I enjoy the process of learning, and would love to hear other's opinions on my work to see what improvements I could make. Overall, I am excited to be challenged to push my abilities and have a supportive environment where I can make mistakes and ultimately improve.

              <td><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong></td>
              <td>
                During Bootcamp, I expect myself to show up on time everyday with a positive mindset. I have committed my time completely to this course, and expect myself to uphold that committment. I will seek help in a timely way by using "10 seconds of confidence;" all I need is a few moments to voice any need for help, and I will actively write down any questions as they arise so that I can ask clearly and concisely. In terms of managing my workload, I will make sure to plan each week ahead of time, booking tasks in my calendar and prioritizing my Dev Academy work over any extra curriculars. I will work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives by being empathetic and respectful of everyone's space and time.

      <h3>Personal standards and learning plan
        <br><em>September 6, 2024</em></h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          With a design and store management background, my <strong>long term goal</strong> is to be in a manegarial position within the technology industry. As a creative yet analytical person, I am excited to transition my skillset over the next few years, expanding my knowledge base and gaining valuable skills that will shape my future career. After being awarded my Bachelor of Design in 2023, I am training at Dev Academy Aotearoa to further my abilities and start my tech career as a full-stack software developer. With a motivated and driven attitude, I am inspired by the consistent new and unique processes developing within the applied sciences. I am excited to broaden my horizons and be part of the innovative, technological approaches that shape our everyday interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have identified a few key <strong>learning strengths and limitations</strong>. My strengths revolve around being extremely independent and driven to achieve at the best of my abilities. From a young age, I have been academically inclined with the ability to pick up new information and skills quickly. This has been very beneficial throughout my schooling experiences, and I always strive to give 100% to each task I undertake. With a high level of optimism and self-discipline, I am reliable and able to effectively manage my time. In the face of difficulty, I am proud of my resilience and adaptability- traits that have enabled me to meet my personal goals alongside task deadlines. On the other hand, one of my limitations is that I am a perfectionist and tend to spend too much time trying to make my projects (regardless of whether it is written, physical, or verbal) match my definition of "perfect." In addition, I have realised through feedback that while I am a great leader I can sometimes end up controlling too many aspects of a project, rather than trusting that my team can also accomplish the same outcomes - or even make something better than what I could. My standards for myself are very high, and I need to work on maintaining realistic and team-friendly expectations. Perhaps, also being okay with a work-in-progress!
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of <strong>non-technical/human skills I would like to develop</strong> while at Dev Academy, I will be focusing on refining my ability to focus and reflect. Following the prep curriculum, I have been very interested in how much we can expand our mental capabilities through everyday activities. For example, I found the tools introduced to facilitate the creation of healthy habits and memorization skills very fascinating. In addition, I would love to work on my ability to work as a team on projects. As I explored previously in my <a href="/blog/identity-values.html">Identity and Values Blog</a>, I have experienced creative team environments that have been slightly challenging to navigate. However, I do believe it is within my abilities to help smooth any issues and work through team disputes which I am excited to practice over the next few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be <strong>committed to managing my workload in this programme</strong> by ensuring I plan each week effectively and realistically. By identifying deadlines and time targets, I am able to complete my tasks - whether that is autonomously or as part of a team - efficiently, ensuring that I have time to make edits based on feedback and my own personal reflections. So far, I have found that asking myself two questions in the morning, and two questions in the evening, has been very effective in centering my attention for the day. Over the past couple of weeks, I have found a rhythm that works for me while completing the Foundations course. Once we reach Bootcamp, I aim to have refined my schedule and turned it into a habit. When working with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives, I will utilize my naturally polite and positive demeanor. Moreover, I believe it is extremely important to provide feedback in a constructive and optimistic way, especially in team environments. On the other hand, when things are building up and starting to get to me, I have been practicing taking a step back, clearing my head, and I find that writing a list that breaks down the issue has resulted in a very productive working mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To seek help in a timely way, I am committing to</strong> spend at least 30 minutes trying to resolve the issue myself through experimentation and researching online, followed by stepping outside of my comfort zone and reaching out to my peers to see if they have encountered the same challenge in their experience. If they also do not have a solution, I will ask Facilitators in the Foundations Help Desk (during Foundations), or in-person (during Bootcamp). Overall, I hope this strategy will ensure that I am taking initiative, while also practicing being comfortable asking for assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My expectations from the Facilitation team</strong> have already been exceeded during the Foundations course so far! Having a supportive environment where I can safely ask questions and get advice is the best learning experience. Personally, when faced with a challenge I prefer to work it out myself as I find this has been the best way to strengthen my knowledge base. If I ask a question when stuck I would love to have guidance or leading questions; however, letting me ultimately resolve the problem (rather than solving it for me) has proved to be extremely beneficial to my learning in the past. As a career changer, it has been reassuring to hear that others are in the same boat. I hope that over the next few months, as we learn more, that we continue to collectively give feedback, utilize the experience of those around us, and help each other improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I do not have any <strong>block-out times when I am committed to other things</strong>. Coming into this course, I am focusing my full attention on the programme to ensure that I give my best possible performance in each task we are given. I have made sure to schedule in exercise throughout the week, such as aerial hoop on Monday evenings, Friday evenings, and Saturday mornings so that I am still getting outdoors around learning and developing my technical abilities.
