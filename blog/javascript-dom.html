            <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals & The DOM<br><em>September 13, 2024</em></h3>
              <div>
                <p>JavaScript, code structured by objects, is an extremely versatile language with the ability to expand the capabilities of a webpage's interactivity. In combination with HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM) developers are able to manipulate different elements within a document to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
                <p><strong>To describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS, an analogy would be</strong> making a pair of shoes. HTML, as the foundational structure, would be how the shoe is made in terms of the different layers and thinking behind their construction. For instance, if there is memory foam in the sole, if it is made from rubber, are the joints stitched together or glued, and what kind of closures are implemented. Next, CSS would arrive as a designer, choosing what material our shoes are made of, what colours are added to each part, how the shape of the shoe looks, and whether there are any top-stitching elements or other design details. Finally, JavaScript would essentially be the person walking around in those shoes to test them, ensuring that users can interact effectively and go about their day comfortably. JavaScript will add different functions to the shoes such as being able to tie the laces, and whether the shoes have any additional features beyond style and construction, similar to the wheels added to Heelies!</p>
                <p><strong>Control flow and loops</strong> direct how information is read on a document. Typically, the default control flow entails the sequence of reading code from the first to last line (top to bottom). Or in the words of MDN Web Docs, "the order in which the computer executes statements in a script." To adapt the order of control flow, structures are used such as loops, conditionals and functions. Below, there is a relevant <a href="#functions-paragraph">functions explanation</a>. To delve into the alternate conditional structures:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Conditionals are decisive statements that determine what code will be executed in different scenarios. Common types of these used in JavaScript include: if, else if, if...else, and switch. In addition, ternary statements check if a condition has been met using a 'true' or 'false' method, followed by a corresponding action. Exactly as they sound, each statement can change the outcome of variables that are presented on a webpage.</li>
                    <li>Loops repeat a given task within the parameters of a given argument. Acting as an iteration, they continue until they are specified to stop- an aspect that is very important to avoid crashing a webpage! The most common type of loop is 'for,' which executes a given action until the conditions have been met.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>An example process from everyday life</strong> to describe control flows and loops would be reading a book. Usually, we would read from front to back (default control flow), however, if we changed where we start reading from using a conditional statement, we may have to look at a glossary on the back cover first. On the other hand, if we specified that we had to read a particular chapter twice instead of once before moving on, this would act as a loop.</p>

                <p><strong>The DOM is identified as</strong> a tool used to access and interact with objects within an HTML document, written within a script. Built like a family tree, the document object deals with everything that lives in the browser, broken down further into what we call 'Nodes.' Encompassing everything that makes up a document such as headers, body, and tables, the DOM is a Web API (application programming interface) that can be used to manipulate, identify and read these different elements by reading them as individual objects. Moreover, developers are able to <strong>interact with the DOM through</strong> different techniques. For example, attaching 'event handlers' that activate when a certain button or key is hit by a user. Or if a webpage has a form, document commands can be used to reload the page with a user's response/any entered information. In addition, by assigning unique identifiers such as 'classes' or 'ids' to different sections, we are able to apply additional specifications to various elements independent of their order within an HTML document. Overall, the Document Object Model is an extremely useful developer tool, acting as a glue that holds HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.</p>

                <p><strong>Accessing data from arrays can be differentiated from accessing objects.</strong> An array is a type of object defined as an index of similar items, usually in a list that starts at 0. Each of these items are assigned a number, and they are accessed based on this numerical value. On the other hand, an object entails a specific key-value pair, where we assign a variable to a corresponding value. In terms of our family tree example, objects are accessed dependent on what specific variable is being edited within it's given value. For instance, if we were wanting to find my surname 'Cupples,' we would access it as a value through the key 'lastName.' It is important to note that objects must be defined first (ExampleObject[lastName] = "Cupples";) before they can be accessed by developers. In comparison to arrays, where we can add more items to the list that can be cycled through, objects refer to a collection of defined properties or characteristics.</p>
                <p id="functions-paragraph"><strong>Functions are another important tool that acts as a very helpful way</strong> to access information multiple times independent of their order on a document. As a fundamental part of Javascript, the declaration of a function will simplify our code by taking input (instructions or parameters for where it is applied) and returning an output (performing a given task on it's parameters). We can manipulate an object through establishing it as a function; in turn, providing an 'argument' that could change it's innerHTML text (content), appearance (properties), and add or remove variables from an object. Notably, a function must be 'called' before the changes are reflected or actions are performed on a webpage.</p>
