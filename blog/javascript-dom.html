                <p>JavaScript, code structured by objects, is an extremely versatile language with the ability to expand the capabilities of a webpage's interactivity. In combination with HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM) developers are able to manipulate different elements within a document to achieve different outcomes.</p>
                <p><strong>To describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS, an analogy would be</strong> making a pair of shoes. HTML, as the foundational structure, would be how the shoe is made in terms of the different layers and thinking behind their construction. For instance, if there is memory foam in the sole, if it is made from rubber, are the joints stitched together or glued, and what kind of closures are implemented. Next, CSS would arrive as a designer, choosing what material our shoes are made of, what colours are added to each part, how the shape of the shoe looks, and whether there are any top-stitching elements or other design details. Finally, JavaScript would essentially be the person walking around in those shoes to test them, ensuring that users can interact effectively and go about their day comfortably. JavaScript will add different functions to the shoes such as being able to tie the laces, and whether the shoes have any additional features beyond style and construction, similar to the wheels added to Heelies!</p>
                <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The DOM is identified as</strong> a tool used to access and interact with objects within an HTML document, written within a script. Built like a family tree, the document object deals with everything that lives in the browser. Encompassing everything that makes up a document such as headers, body, and tables, the DOM is a Web API (application programming interface) that can be used to manipulate, identify and read these different elements by reading them as individual objects. Moreover, developers are able to <strong>interact with the DOM through</strong> different techniques. For example, attaching 'event handlers' that activate when a certain button or key is hit by a user. Or if a webpage has a form, document commands can be used to reload the page with a user's response/any entered information. In addition, by assigning unique identifiers such as 'classes' or 'ids' to different sections, we are able to apply additional specifications to various elements independent of their order within an HTML document. Overall, the Document Object Model is an extremely useful developer tool, acting as a glue that holds HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.</p>
                <p><strong>Accessing data from arrays can be differentiated from accessing objects.</strong> An array is defined as a collection of similar items, usually in a list that starts at 0. Each of these items are assigned a number, and they are accessed based on this numerical value. On the other hand, an object entails a specific key-value pair, where we assign a variable to a corresponding value. In terms of our family tree example, objects are accessed dependent on what specific variable is being edited within it's given value. For instance, if we were wanting to find my surname 'Cupples,' we would access it as a value through the key 'lastName.' It is important to note that objects must be defined first (ExampleObject[lastName] = "Cupples";) before they can be accessed by developers. In comparison to arrays, where we can add more items to the list, objects refer to specific defined information.</p>
                <p><strong>Functions are another important aspect of JavaScript, as a very helpful way</strong> to </p>
